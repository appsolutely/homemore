This is the manage shelter page - it consists of:

ManageOccupants
ManagerProfile
ManagerProfileEdit
ManagerProfileView
ManageUnits
ShowOccupants




Hierarchy is as such:

ManagerProfile <- List of all shelters under manager’s care

ShowOccupants <— sibling component to ManagerProfile - loads on click on shelter
  ManagerProfileView
  ManagerProfileEdit 
  ManageOccupants
  ManageUnits

Again, please note that ShowOccupants is *not* a child of ManagerProfile

ShowOccupants is navigated to upon clicking an individual shelter, but it 

inherits nothing from ManagerProfile.
